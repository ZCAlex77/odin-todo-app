# odin-todo-app

### Description

A todo app that lets you add todos and organise them into projects. I made this app following a lesson on theodinproject.com to practice using webpack.

### Preview

### Features

- add/remove projects from the "Projects" section
- add todos to the selected project by pressing "New todo" button
- show all todos by pressing "Todos" button (above the todo list)
- check/delete todos from the first 2 buttons on the todo
- expand todo to see saved notes for it from the last button on the todo

### Things I learned from this
- how to use webpack to bundle files
- how to create factory functions and modules
- how to split my code into different modules/factories for each purpose of the app
